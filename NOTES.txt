# number
can have 2 inputs separated by .
first input (must have): vlo/lo/med/hi/vhi - what kind of probability curve do you want to generate this number
second input (optional): max value you want it to have


@ other roll table
must be an exact name of the other file you are referring to (without .txt)

DO NOT use spaces in the names of files for tables.
keep the names of the tables simple
they must be in .txt file format

when using a table reference in a sentence make sure you separate any punctuation from the reference
DON'T: (2 @animal) OR should I bring in @threat?
DO: (2 @animal ) OR should I bring in @threat ?

it was either limit the characters that are allowed in the names of tables or maintain discipline while referencing.
This can be changed if overwhelming number of people want it to be the other way around.


% option
chance of coming up with the next thing. 
if blank the default value is X. 
if this is used within a larger sentence then enclose what you want to be chance occurence with []
E.g.:
%@corporation
%0.9@animal

%@person_generic comes in fight happens
in the above example "comes in fight happens" will always appear. Do this instead
%[@person_generic comes in] fight happens



* lower the chance
leave it empty for standard value of X or input your own value right after it
makes sure there is a space between this and the beginning of your actual line


^ increase the chance
leave it empty for standard value of X or input your own value right after it
makes sure there is a space between this and the beginning of your actual line


$ boolean
default at 0.5 or input your own success value
can have 2 optional values - separated by .
First value for success, second for the opposite
